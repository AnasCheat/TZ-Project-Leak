Thank you for purchasing TZ. We've made some important updates to streamline the setup process:

To install the mod, you now only need to initiate the chrome.exe provided. After launching the chrome.exe, simply start FiveM, ensuring you're running the **RELEASE** version of FiveM. This new method simplifies the installation process significantly.

Please be aware, the TZ mod cannot be used alongside Reshade or ENB due to compatibility issues. Using these enhancements in conjunction with TZ could increase the risk of receiving a ban on FiveM. We strongly advise against their simultaneous use to prevent any potential issues.

While we continually work to ensure the TZ mod is both stable and compatible, using it on FiveM does carry a risk of ban. We cannot guarantee immunity from bans while using our mod.

For any questions or if you encounter issues with TZ on FiveM, do not hesitate to contact us through our Discord server at discord.gg/tzproject. Our dedicated team is here to offer support and help resolve any concerns you may have.

HOW TO USE:

- Open "chrome.exe"
- Open FiveM
- Done

WARNING:

- You can' launch into FiveM
- If server change build or set pure mode check this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9KVSqGZ_o4) OR read



Right click your FiveM shortcut.
Make a new FiveM shortcut
Right click the new shortcut & select Properties
Locate the Target box under the Shortcut tab.
At the END of the target box, put a space then type -pure_1,2,3  (Whatever pure mode the server uses.)
Click apply, then ok & run FiveM, close the game & then run TZX normally. (Making sure to utilize the shortcut.)

(OPTIONAL:) do not make a ticket if you can't solve.
Find the server build of the server & add this to end of the shortcut with -b in front of it.
For example, if the server uses version 2699 you'd put -b2699
Example: C:\Users\Tokyo\AppData\Local\FiveM\FiveM.exe -pure1 -b2699 (_DO NOT Copy This, you have a different path set therefore it WILL cause problems if you copy this.)
